A 15% restocking fee might be applied to opened electronics that are not defective. Software, gift cards, and items marked as "Final Sale" cannot be returned.

Warranty Information
All products with the "Quantum Gadgets" brand name come with a 1-year limited warranty. This warranty covers defects in manufacturing and hardware failure. It does not cover accidental damage, water damage, or misuse. To make a warranty claim, email our support team with your order number and a description of the problem. For third-party products, the manufacturer's warranty applies.

Privacy Policy
We value your privacy. We collect customer information like name, address, and email solely for the purpose of processing orders and providing customer support. We do not sell or share your personal data with third-party marketers. Our website uses cookies to enhance user experience and for analytics.

We offer a price match guarantee on identical, in-stock items from major authorized online retailers (e.g., Best Buy, Amazon). To request a price match, please contact our support team with a link to the competitor's product page *before* you place your order. The price match is based on the final, pre-tax price.

If your item arrives defective or damaged, please contact customer support within 7 days of delivery. We will arrange for a replacement or a full refund at no cost to you. The 15% restocking fee does not apply to defective items.

FAQ: Why is my promo code not working?
There are a few possible reasons: the code may have expired, it may have been typed incorrectly, or it may not apply to the items in your cart. For example, some codes exclude certain categories like "Drones" or "Final Sale" items. Please double-check the code and its terms.

FAQ: Is the Nova Smartwatch waterproof?
The Nova Smartwatch V3 has a 5ATM water resistance rating. This means it is suitable for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. It is not considered fully waterproof and should not be used for high-velocity water sports, scuba diving, or in a hot tub or sauna.

FAQ: How do I pair my Aura Headphones?
To pair your Aura Noise-Cancelling Headphones, turn them on and hold the power button for 5 seconds until the LED light flashes blue and red. Then, go to the Bluetooth settings on your device (phone, computer) and select "Aura Headphones" from the list of available devices.
